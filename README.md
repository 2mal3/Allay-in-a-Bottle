Transport Allays with bottles!
A lightweight datapack prototype to transport Allays more easily over longer distances.
To catch or release, simply right-click with a bottle (doesn't always work first time).

## ðŸ“’ Notes:
- Tested for Fabric and Vanilla in 1.19
- To uninstall run the command `/function aiab:core/uninstall`
- The datapack was created with [mc-build](https://github.com/mc-build/mc-build).
