> The resourcepack needed for the datapack is the same file as the datapack. You have to move the downloaded file into the Datapack **and** into the Resourcepack folder.

> This version is made to be used with the [Bottle O' Light Datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/bottle-o-light/), so you can only capture Allays with the Amethyst Bottle added in this datapack.
> The normal version is available [here](https://github.com/2mal3/Allay-in-a-Bottle)
